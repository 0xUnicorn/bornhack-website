      <h2>Where do I sleep?</h2>
        <h4>Tents</h4>
        <p>
          BornHack is first and foremost a tent camp. You need to bring a tent
          to sleep in. Most people go with some friends and make a camp somewhere
          at the venue. See also the section on Villages further down.
        </p>

        <h4>Cabins</h4>
        <p>
          We also have a few cabins onsite with 8 beds each for people who 
          don't want to sleep in tents for some reason. A tent is the 
          cheapest sleeping option, but the cabins are there if you want them.

      <h2>How do I get to Bornholm?</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>From/Via Copenhagen</dt>
        <dd>
          There are several ways to get to Bornholm from Copenhagen.
          A domestic plane departs from Copenhagen Airport, and you
          can get from Copenhagen Central station by either bus or
          train via Ystad or the Køge-Rønne ferry connection.
        </dd>

        <dt>Plane (expensive)</dt>
        <dd>
          You can check plane departures and book tickets at
          <a href="https://www.dat.dk/en/" target="_blank">dat.dk</a>. There are
          multiple departures daily. The flight takes approximately
          35 minutes.

        <dt>Via Køge (cheap)</dt>
        <dd>
          Take the S-train to Køge Station (you need an "all zones"
          ticket) or travel by car. The ferry terminal is within
          walking distance from the station. You can check out
          prices
          <a href="http://www.faergen.com/services/fares/bornholmerfaergen/koege-roenne.aspx" target="_blank">here</a>.
          It takes approximately 1 hour to get to Køge. The crossing

        </dd>

        <dt>Sassnitz (Germany)</dt>
        <dd>
          There is a direct ferry taking cars going from <a href="http://www.faergen.com/services/fares/bornholmerfaergen/sassnitz-roenne.aspx" target="_blank">Sassnitz</a>.

      <p>
        The venue is 24km from Rønne Havn. We will have a shuttle bus
        that will pick people up and take them to the venue. It is also 
        possible to take a public bus to near the venue. Local taxis can also
        get you here.

      <h2>What kind of power supply can I expect?</h2>
        We are working on sorting out the details. Power is a standard European
        230V supply with type <a href="http://www.worldstandards.eu/electricity/plugs-and-sockets/" target="_blank">K plugs</a>.
        Standard red 400V 16A CEE plugs will also be possible.

      <h2>I need to eat!</h2>
        <h4>Food vendors</h4>
        <p>
          There will be a local food vendor (from the town Nexø) at the venue. He sells
          high quality sausages and burgers, Danish style. We are also looking
          into an agreement with a nearby pizza delivery place. More on that 
          later.
        </p>

        <h4>Cooking</h4>
        <p>
          We know that hackers like to cook for themselves, not only limited 
          because of vegetarians/vegan diets. Everyone is encouraged to cook
          their own food, either in their own village kitchen or in the food 
          area. Please note that coal powered barbeques are <b>strictly 
          forbidden</b> on the camp grounds for fire safety reasons. If you 
          want to cook with coal use the big barbeque in the food area! 
          Gas and electrical barbeques are allowed in villages.
        </p>

        <h4>The food area</h4>
        <p>
          Part of the food area is a large outdoor kitchen area
          where participants are invited to cook their meals.
          <ul>
            <li>Seating for 80 people</li>
            <li>An outdoor kitchen with running water and tables for food preparation</li>
            <li>Ample barbeque capacity, including a barbeque exclusive to vegans/vegetatians. We sell coal in the kiosk.</li>
          </ul>
          Villages without a kitchen of their own are very welcome to utilize 
          this area for cooking. Please clean up after yourselves! :)
        </p>

        <h4>Buying groceries</h4>
        <p>
          The closest place to buy groceries is approximately
          3.5 km away at Pedersker. About 7 km from the venue there 
          is a larger selection at Aakirkeby. We have a shuttle bus that
          will transport participants to and from grocery shopping, for free.

      <h2>Bar area</h2>
      <p>
        The bar area is the place to go when you are all hacked out and want
        to socialize with the other participants. Enjoy a cold beer or drink
        and some music, and discuss your projects with the people around you.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bar will be run with an open budget and flexible prices. More on
        that later.
      </p>
      <p>
        Opening hours of the bar have not been decided yet (but they will be
        compatible with the average hackers sleep cycle).

      <h2>
        Villages
      </h2>
      <p>If this is your first hackercamp the term 'Village' might be
        confusing but it is fairly simple: a village is just a spot on the
        campsite where you and a bunch of your friends/likeminded people camp
        together. Apart from peoples individual tents which they sleep in, many
        villages bring a large common tent where you can hack and hang out
        during the day.
      </p>
      <p>Villages can also rent village tents via us, head over to the
       <a href="{% url 'shop:index' %}?category=villages">
         villages section of the shop</a>.
       The tents will be ready for when you arrive and will be taken down
       again saturday the 3rd of September at 12:00. The tents have optional
       floors and you can rent folding tables and chairs as needed. You do not
       have to register a village or have a concept to rent a big tent.
      </p>
      <p><a href="{% url 'villages:list' %}">You can register your village here</a>!
        If you don't want to make your own village you might be able to
        find and join one that suits your interests. Get in touch with the
        <a href="mailto:villages@bornhack.org">villages team</a> if you have 
        any questions!

        The shop/kiosk
      </h2>
      <p>BornHack will have a small shop/kiosk where you can buy a small
      selection of stuff you might need. We sell candy and a bit of food,
      softdrinks, charcoal for the barbeques, network cables, power adapters,
      a small selection of electronics, and so on. The kiosk will also sell
      coffee (freshly ground quality beans) and tea.
      </p>

      <p>The kiosk will be open from 8:00 in the morning (so hackers can 
        get their morning coffee) until 20:00 in the evening. After 20:00 
        you can still get coffee, tea and softdrinks at the bar. But make
        sure you buy charcoal and other things you might need (for cooking
        late for example).

      <dl>

          <dd>This is where you pick up any tshirts and other merchandise you bought</dd>

        Basically, the infodesk is where you go when you don't know where
        else to go. It will be manned from 10:00 in the morning until 20:00 in
        the evening. But CERT is 24/7 of course, and if the infodesk is closed,
        there is a phonenumber and a bell so you can get a hold of us.
