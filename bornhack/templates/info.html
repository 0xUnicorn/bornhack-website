      <h2>How do I get to Bornholm?</h2>
      <h3>From/Via Copenhagen</h3>
      <p>
        There are several ways to get to Bornholm from Copenhagen.
        A domestic plane departs from Copenhagen Airport, and you
        can get from Copenhagen Central station by either bus or
        train via Ystad or the Køge-Rønne ferry connection.

        <h3>Food vendors</h3>
        <p>
          There will be a few food vendors at the venue,
          and we are working on agreements with nearby food 
          delivery places. If you are interested in becoming a food
          vendor please contact us.
        </p>

        <h3>Cooking</h3>
        <p>
          We know that hackers like to cook for themselves for
          various reasons, not limited to vegetarians/vegan diets. Everyone
          is welcome to cook their own food, either in their own village 
          kitchen or in the food area. Please note that coal powered barbeques
          are <b>strictly forbidden</b> on the camp grounds for fire
          safety reasons. If you want to cook with coal use the big 
          barbeque in the food area! Gas barbeques are allowed in villages.
        </p>

        <h3>The food area</h3>
        <p>
          The venue has a roofed outdoor food area with:
          <ul>
            <li>Seating for 80 people</li>
            <li>An outdoor kitchen with running water and tables for food preparation</li>
            <li>A large coal powered barbeque (we sell coal in the info kiosk)</li>
          </ul>
          Villages without a kitchen of their own are very welcome to utilize 
          this area for cooking. Please clean up after yourselves! :)
        </p>

        <h3>Buying groceries</h3>
        <p>
          The closest place to buy groceries is approximately
          3.5 km away at Pedersker. About 7 km from the venue there 
          is a larger selection at Aakirkeby. We are looking into
          the possibility of shuttle busses to and from the grocery places.

      <h2>Bar area</h2>
      <p>
        The bar area is the place to go when you a all hacked out and want
        to socialize with the other participants. Enjoy a cold beer or drink
        and some music, and discuss your projects with the people around you.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bar will be run with an open budget and flexible prices. More on
        that later.
      </p>
      <p>
        Opening hours of the bar have not been decided yet (but they will be
        compatible with the average hackers sleep cycle).
