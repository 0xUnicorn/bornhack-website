<h2>Sponsoring</h2>

<p>We Are Looking for sponsors to help us make BornHack an unforgettable 
event and allow it to grow. If you would like to sponsor us do not hesitate 
to contact us at <a href="mailto:sponsors@bornhack.dk">sponsors@bornhack.dk</a>. 
If you work for a company that you believe might be able and willing to 
sponsor BornHack please direct the right people to this page.</p>

<p>You can read more about the event and possible areas of your
sponsorship below.</p>

<h3>The Concept</h3>
<p>The idea and basic concept of BornHack comes from participation
in similar camps in Germany and the Netherlands. These events
have a huge traction (several thousand participants) and we therefore
think the time is right for another one.</p>

<h3>The Organisers</h3>
<p>BornHack is a technology festival put together by a group of
people from Denmark and Sweden employed in the local IT industry.
The organiser group have a burning desire to set up a forum where
people with different interests in IT and technology can come together
to share ideas and socialize. Several of the co-organisers have 
previously been (or are still) involved in organising conferences such as
<a href="https://opensourcedays.org/">Open Source Days</a>.</p>

<h3>Location and Format</h3>
<p>The first BornHack will be inviting 350 paying guests for a full
week, the ambition is to grow the number of attendees over the coming 
years. It will take place at <a href="http://jarlsgaard.dk">Jarlsgaard</a> 
on Bornholm, Denmark, where we have a gigabit fiber connection 
to the outside world. Hopefully the weather will be with us as well.</p>

<h3>Sponsorship</h3>
<p>A sponsorship can be in the range of 5000 DKK and up. You get
to have a logo of your choice placed on our website in the sponsors
section, as well as mentions in written material such as programs
where sponsors will be disclosed.</p>

<p>Sponsors often prefer to sponsor a certain area or event at the 
camp, where we will figure out an appropriate display in cooperation 
with you. Suggested sponsorships include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bar area (decorations, building materials, inventory)</li>
  <li>Lounge area (couches, hammocks, decoration)</li>
  <li>Food area (renting barbeques and buying charcoal)</li>
  <li>Speakers tent(s)</li>
  <li>Sound system in speakers tent(s)</li>
  <li>Shuttle buses</li>
  <li>Insurance</li>
  <li>Toilet facilities</li>
  <li>Coffee cart</li>

</ul>
