  <hr />
  <p class="lead">
    Bornhack is a camp where hackers, makers and people with an interest
    in technology come together for a week to celebrate technology,
    socialise and have fun.
  </p>

  <p class="lead">
    It takes place for the first time from August 27 to September
    3rd 2016 on the Danish island Bornholm where we have found the
    geography as well as backbone to make it happen.
  </p>

  <p class="lead">
    Bornhack is a participatory event where we expect people to come
    up with crazy ideas and help make the content. We will try to
    attract interesting people for holding talks and make workshops,
    but this is just a frame - the rest is up to you.
  </p>

  <p class="lead">
    We hope you will show your interest by signing onto our mailing-list as
    soon as we get it up. In the meantime you are very much welcome to ask
    questions and show your interest on IRC at #bornhack on irc.freenode.net
    such that you can help us understand what you
    think would be fun to do.  This is a new event, so we don't yet
    know exactly where this is going - but give us your feedback and
    you can help us form it.
  </p>

  <p class="lead">
    We hope you want to be a part of Bornhack
