    <strong>Bornhack</strong> is a camp where hackers, makers and people with
    an interest in technology come together for a week to celebrate technology,
    socialise and <strong>have fun</strong>.
  </p>

  <p class="lead">
    It takes place for the first time from <strong>August 27 to September 3rd
    2016</strong> on the Danish island <strong>Bornholm</strong> where we
    have found the geography as well as backbone to make it happen.
  </p>

  <p class="lead">
    Bornhack is a <strong>participatory</strong> event where we expect people
    to come up with crazy ideas and help make the content. We will try to
    attract interesting people for holding talks and make workshops, but this
    is just a frame - <strong>the rest is up to you</strong>.
  </p>

  <p class="lead">
    We hope you will show your interest by signing onto our mailing-list as
    soon as we get it up. In the meantime you are very much welcome to ask
    questions and show your interest on IRC at <strong>#bornhack</strong> on
    <strong>6nbtgccn5nbcodn3.onion:6697 (TLS)</strong> (<strong>irc.baconsvin.org:6697 (TLS)</strong>)
    such that you can help us understand what you think would be fun to do.
    This is a new event, so we don't yet know exactly where this is going - but
    give us your feedback and you can help us form it.
  </p>

  <p class="lead">
    We hope you want to be a part of Bornhack
