        <strong>Bornhack</strong> is a 7 day outdoor camp where hackers, makers
        and people with an interest in technology and security come together to
        celebrate technology, socialise, learn and <strong>have fun</strong>.
      </p>

      <p class="lead">
        It takes place for the first time from <strong>August 27 to September 3rd
        2016</strong> on the Danish island of <strong>Bornholm</strong> where we
        have found the geography and backbone to make it happen.
      </p>

      <p class="lead">
        Bornhack is a <strong>participatory</strong> event where we expect people
        to come up with ideas and projects, and help make the content. We will reach out to
        people to ensure interesting, high quality talks and workshops.
      </p>

      <p class="lead">
        You are very welcome to ask questions and show your interest on IRC at
