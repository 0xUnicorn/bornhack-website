<p>
  If this is your first hackercamp the term 'Village' might be confusing but it is fairly simple: a village is just a spot on the campsite where you and a bunch of your friends/likeminded people camp together. Apart from peoples individual tents which they sleep in, many villages bring a large common tent where you can hack and hang out during the day.
